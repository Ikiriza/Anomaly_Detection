'*'Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest'*'

Isolation Concept
The Isolation Forest algorithm works on the principle that anomalies are easier to isolate than normal instances. It constructs an ensemble of isolation trees where each tree partitions the dataset by randomly selecting features and split values. Anomalies are expected to be isolated closer to the root of the trees, requiring fewer splits.

Random Partitioning
The algorithm builds trees by randomly selecting a feature and a split value for each partition. Multiple trees are constructed independently. This randomization makes the algorithm efficient and suitable for high-dimensional data with minimal parameter tuning.

Anomaly Score
Anomalies are detected based on the average depth of the isolation trees in which a data point resides. Points that are isolated closer to the root of the trees have lower average depths, resulting in higher anomaly scores.

Scalability
Isolation Forest is efficient and scalable, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. The average time complexity for building an isolation tree is 
ùëÇ(logùëÅ)
O(logN), where 
ùëÅ
N is the number of instances in the dataset.

Handling High-Dimensional Data
Isolation Forest is less affected by the curse of dimensionality compared to traditional methods and can effectively handle datasets with many features.

Outlier Detection
The algorithm is well-suited for outlier detection tasks, making it useful for identifying rare events or unusual patterns.

One-Class Learning
Isolation Forest is a one-class learning algorithm, suitable for unsupervised tasks where only normal instances are available during training. It does not require labeled anomaly examples for training.

Class Methods
__init__(): Initializes the AnomalyDetection object with default parameters.
simulate_data_stream(num_points=500): Simulates a data stream with regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise. Returns a DataFrame with timestamps and values.
process_data_stream(data_stream): Processes the data stream in real-time, performs anomaly detection, and updates the internal DataFrame. Visualizes anomalies periodically.
visualize_real_time(index): Visualizes the data stream and detected anomalies in real-time. Plots the last 100 points and highlights anomalies.
